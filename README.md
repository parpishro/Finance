# Personal Finance Manager

## A java application to record financial transactions and provide financial reports and visualization 

*What will the application do?*

The application will track all financial transactions of a user through user input as a transaction entry, organize and
record them in their respective categories and provides default and user-specified report tables and visualizations
from different categories and account to inform the user about specific aspect of their finances or their overall
financial status.


*Who will use it?*

The application is designed for personal use by an individual user. However, this application can also be used to manage
the finances of a family or any small-scale entity.


*Why is this project of interest to you?*

I have always wanted to have a some application to track all my finances across different accounts and categories. Some
corporate accounts such as investment and banking application provide a limited version of this service, but their
service is platform-specific. There are also some third-party applications that provide this service but the way in
which they preserve the privacy of user is not acceptable or questionable at best. Financial data is among most
sensitive personal data and is sought actively by a variety of entities. For mentioned reasons, it is almost impossible
to record and track financial transactions in a single application safely and privately. This application will allow to
save and manage my financial data on my personal storage. It also provides different tables and visualizations to track
certain aspect of my finances or my overall financial status.
